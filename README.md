# Analysis_of_Violence_in_Rio_de_Janeiro

Rio de Janeiro is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Home to many of Brazil's most famous artists and monuments, the marvelous city attracts millions of tourists every year, making it the second most visited city in South America.

In spite of its breathtaking natural setting and exciting culture, Rio faces many problems when it comes to fighting crime.

In my latest project, I've analyzed the data available on crime in Rio, with the objective of better understanding the situation of the city.

If you want to learn more about this astonishing city, make sure to check out my project and let me know what you think!
